- python_files/sputnik.py generated everything in /example_output. the code currently dumps text files in the archive folder, but this should happen in a separate folder with corresponding file names, as youâ€™ll see in /example_output.
- python_files/WikiRefGetter.py generated everything in to_parse. The first step of this project will probably be extracting all of the text from the files named index.html. Note that this code does not name the files index.html, as this was done manually. Your downloader code should do this automatically.
